        "\n",
        "In Langchain, **Chains** are powerful, reusable components that can be linked together to perform complex tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Chains can be formed using various types of components, such as:\n",
        " - prompts,\n",
        " - models,\n",
        " - arbitrary functions,\n",
        " - or even other chains\n",
        "\n",
        "🔄 Chains allow you to combine language models with other data sources and third-party APIs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are a few examples of the diverse types of Chains you can create in Langchain:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **LLM Chain**: The most common chain. Takes an input, formats it, and passes it to an LLM for processing. Basic components are PromptTemplate, an LLM, and an optional output parser.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Sequential Chain**: A series of Chains executed in a specific order. There are different variations, including:\n",
        "- SimpleSequentialChain - singular input/output with output of one step as input to the next\n",
        "- SequentialChain - allows for multiple inputs/outputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Index Chains**: These combine your data stored in indexes with LLMs. Useful for question answering over your own documents.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **BashChain**: A specialized chain for running filesystem commands.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **LLM Math**: Designed to solve complex word math problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "# 🖊️ Prompts in Langchain: A Quick Guide\n",
        "\n",
        "In Langchain, **Prompts** guide the responses of Language Models (LLMs).\n",
        "\n",
        "## 📝 Prompt Template\n",
        "\n",
        "A **Prompt Template** is not just a static question or instruction, but rather a dynamic and adaptable way to generate a prompt for the LLM.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "It's a string that takes multiple inputs and generate a structured prompt tailored for those inputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Prompt Templates may also contain specific instructions for the LLM, a set of \"few-shot\" examples to help guide the LLM's response, and possibly a direct question to be answered by the LLM.\n",
        "\n",
        "Prompt Templates simplify the process of managing complex or varied inputs, and can make your code cleaner and more maintainable.\n",
        "\n",
